# Session Notes

## Purpose

This file contains summaries of completed development sessions. Each entry provides a high-level overview of what was accomplished, key findings, and outcomes. This helps maintain context across sessions and serves as a historical record of the project's evolution.

**Update this file at the END of each session by summarizing your work from `scratch/working-notes.md`.**

## Example Session

## Session: Project Setup and Initial Backend Tests - Nov 11, 2025

### Accomplished
- Created working memory system in `.github/memory/`
- Set up directory structure with session notes, patterns, and scratch workspace
- Documented memory system workflow in README.md
- Established convention for committed vs non-committed development notes

### Key Findings
- Need clear separation between ephemeral working notes and permanent knowledge
- Scratch directory with .gitignore prevents accidental commits of messy notes
- Pattern documentation is most valuable when it captures reusable solutions
- AI assistants benefit from structured context in documented patterns

### Outcomes
- Memory system fully operational and documented
- Developers can now track development discoveries systematically
- Foundation for accumulating project-specific knowledge over time
- Clear workflow for session start, active work, and session end
